# flask_simple_project

hello this is a simple flask project that i created from "Tech With Tim" youtube channel
And this project made me come up with a lot of ideas

for run this project you should first clone and it's better to create a virtualenvironment after that
then install requirment.txt
for run project you must type code bellow :

In linux : 
  export FLASK_APP=main.py
 In windows : 
  set FLASK_APP=main.py
  
  and then type flask run 
        
          
          Enjoy It !!!
